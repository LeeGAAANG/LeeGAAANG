<p>In 1904, British businessman Gus Meyers bought a playground in Fulham, London, and wanted to use it as a football field.
   Meyers attempted to transfer the stadium to nearby Fulham FC, but when refused, he decided to start a new team on the pitch.
   Chelsea was formally formed on March 10, 1905, at a bar called Rising Sun.
   In June 2003, Chelsea was sold for Â£ 140 million to Russian oil conglomerate Roman Abramovich.
